<h2>The Game of Life (1P Mode)</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
  A variation of Conway's Game of Life in which the player can interact with the game state.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
  Captivation.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
  Puzzle.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
  Player can click on any "life tile" on the grid. A light tile is alive and a dark tile is not alive. Clicking on an alive tile kills it and clicking on a tile thatis not alive gives it life. If there is only 1 or 0 alive tiles left the game is lost.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
  It is a spin on a popular game, in which a player can now interact with the interesting aspects of the original Game of Life.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
  Conway's Game of Life.
</li>
